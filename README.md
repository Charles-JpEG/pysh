Combine python3 and posix shell

## Overview
A project to combine python3 and posix shell, try it out if you're suffering from scripting with bash

## Dependencies
At least one posix compliant shell and python3
- Use grep -G if your grep version does not support -P Perl regex, or install a newer GNU grep

## Usage \<Not yet implemented\>
- Very similar to the shell you're used to, you can still cd to change directory or grep to filter output
- Besides you can use python functions directly like print()
- use import to load python modules
