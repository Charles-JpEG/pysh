Combine python3 and posix shell

## Overview
A project to combine python3 and posix shell, try it out if you're suffering from scripting with bash

## Dependencies
At least one posix compliant shell and python3

## Usage <Not yet implemented>
- Very similar to the shell you're used to, you can still cd to change directory or grep to filter output
- Besides you can use python functions directly like print()
- use import to load python modules
